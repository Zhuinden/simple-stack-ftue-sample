# Simple-Stack FTUE Sample

Sample code using [simple-stack](https://github.com/Zhuinden/simple-stack/) to display "First-Time User Experience", based on an older version of "Conditional Navigation" section of Jetpack Navigation documentation.

You can also see the same concept implemented using Jetpack Navigation in [the Jetpack Navigation FTUE sample](https://github.com/Zhuinden/jetpack-navigation-ftue-sample/)).
